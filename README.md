**ama anything abt it on discord, try to respond as quickly as possible my discord: bazingers**
**y = yes n = no, the ones that says y/n only respond with yes or no but in y/n form**
**its written it python (.py) so run in into something that can run .py, it can be repl.it if u dont have any programs that can run python lolol**
**btw when they ask to answer y again if u did it before (4 digit method) its just to make things easier bc in the first question we get half of the 4 digits and in the other we get the other half**
